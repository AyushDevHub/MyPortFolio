## File Structure

```
/portfolio
|-- index.html         # Main HTML file
|-- style.css          # Stylesheet for the portfolio
|-- script.js          # JavaScript file to handle dark mode and loader
|-- /images            # Folder containing images (avatar, social icons, etc.)
|-- /documents         # Folder containing your resume and other documents
```

- **script.js**: Handles dark mode toggling and loading animations.

## Dark Mode

The portfolio includes a **dark mode toggle** that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. This feature is implemented using a simple checkbox and JavaScript event listeners.

### How it Works:

1. The checkbox input in the `.lightDark` div triggers a function `DarkMode()` in the JavaScript file when clicked.
2. When the checkbox is checked, the `dark` class is added to the `body` tag, changing the background to dark mode.
3. Specific elements have their box-shadow styles removed when dark mode is active to enhance visibility.

## Loader Animation

When the page is loading, a fun interactive animation is displayed. The loader is an animated hand with "thumbs-up" gestures, indicating that the page is being loaded. This feature is controlled by the `loading()` function in `script.js`.
